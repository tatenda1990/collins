# Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub Profile!
Hello there. My name is Tatenda and I am passionate about programming, data science and machine learning, primarily using Python. I am a Chemical / Process Engineer with experience in developing metallurgical processes. I hold a BEng from NUST and an MSc in Metallurgy from University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. I am currently working as a metallurgist located in the Modderfontein area in Johannesburg. My intention is to develop data engineering and machine learning skills for deploying data driven solutions for optimizing process plant operations. 

Check out my (still growing) profile and portfolio for some of my projects and micro-projects.
